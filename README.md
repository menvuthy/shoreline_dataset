**Abstract:** Drought is a natural hazard that stresses ecosystems, agricultural production, food security,
and local economies. Given ongoing hydropower dam development in the Sesan and Srepok Basins,
the two most dammed tributaries in the Lower Mekong Basin, characterizing baseline drought events
and understanding how dams modify downstream flow is needed to manage water resources and
mitigate drought effects. We used the Soil &Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate streamflow
data from 2001 to 2019. For both rivers, we found that runoff varied, but contributed about 75% of
streamflow, followed by shallow and deep groundwater, which contributed up to 25%. We used the
Standardized Runoff Index to characterize drought and detected frequent, severe, and prolonged
drought events in the two basins. Severe and prolonged droughts in the 2009–2011 and 2015–2016
periods corresponded to the occurrence of Typhoon Ketsana and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
Streamflow alteration can be caused by climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities such as
hydropower dam development and operations (e.g., the timing and magnitude of water releases).
Results from this study can be used as a baseline to gauge potential future droughts and design
appropriate drought management plans to preserve ecosystems and food security in the Lower
Mekong Basin and its tributaries.
